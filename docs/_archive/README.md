## Archive Policy

- Files are moved here when they become outdated or superseded
- Each archived file includes a tombstone header explaining why it was archived
- Archived files are not updated or maintained
- They serve as historical reference only

## Tombstone Header Format

Each archived file should include a header like this:

```markdown
<!-- ARCHIVED: [DATE] -->
<!-- REASON: [Why this file was archived] -->
<!-- REPLACEMENT: [Link to current documentation] -->
<!-- ARCHIVED BY: [Who archived it] -->

[Original content follows...]
```
